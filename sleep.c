 * \brief declare a time to sleep.
 *
 * This function is called in a syscall context and make the task
 * unschedulable for at least the given sleeptime. Only external events
 * (ISR, IPC) can awake the task during this period. If no external events
 * happend, the task is marked as schedulable at the end of the sleep period,
 * which means that the task is schedule *after* the sleep time, not exactly
 * at the sleep time end.
 * The variation of the time to wait between the end of the sleep time and
 * the effective time execution depends on the scheduling policy, the task
 * priority and the number of tasks on the system.
 *
 * \param id        the task id requesting to sleep
 * \param sleeptime the sleep duration in unit given by unit argument
 * \param unit      the unit of the sleep time, which is one of sleep_unit_t
